# HLTB for Steam

A [Millennium](https://steambrew.app/) plugin that displays [How Long To Beat](https://howlongtobeat.com/) completion times on game pages in the Steam library and store.

![Desktop Mode](example_desktop.png)

![Big Picture Mode](example_bigPictureMode.png)

## Features

- Shows HLTB completion times on library game pages and store pages:
  - Main Story
  - Main + Extras
  - Completionist
- Works in both Desktop and Big Picture modes
- Caches results to disk, optionally clear via the settings page
- Click "View Details" to open the full HLTB page

## Requirements

- [Millennium](https://steambrew.app/) installed on Steam
- Windows or Linux

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Millennium installed on your Steam client
2. Navigate to HLTB from the [plugins page](https://steambrew.app/plugins)
3. Click the "Copy Plugin ID" button
4. Back in Steam, go to Steam menu > Millenium > Plugins > Install a plugin and paste the code
5. Follow the remaining instructions to install and enable the plugin

## Usage

Once installed, HLTB data automatically appears on game pages in your Steam library and on store pages. Simply click on any game to see its completion times.

## How It Works

On startup, if your Steam profile is public, the plugin fetches your library from HLTB's Steam import API. This provides a direct mapping from Steam app IDs to HLTB game IDs, which is more reliable than name-based search and avoids issues with mismatched game names.

When you view a game page:

1. The plugin detects the Steam App ID from the page
2. If a cached HLTB ID exists (from the Steam import), it fetches data directly by ID
3. Otherwise, it falls back to name-based search: queries Steam for the game name, applies fixes, then searches HLTB
4. Results are cached to disk and displayed

The same caching and lookup logic is shared between the library and store views.

If your Steam profile is private, the plugin will still work using name-based search but it may be less reliable.

## Settings

Access settings via Steam menu > Millennium Library Manager > HLTB for Steam.

Library view:
- Show in Library (default = true): Show or hide HLTB data in the library
- Horizontal/Vertical Offset (default = 0): Offset from the aligned edge, useful for avoiding Steam UI elements
- Align to Right / Align to Bottom (default = true): Position the box on the header image
- Show View Details Link (default = true): Toggle the link to the HLTB game page

Store view:
- Show in Store (default = true): Show or hide HLTB data on store pages
- Position (default = Achievements): Where to insert the HLTB box in the store sidebar
- Show View Details Link (default = true): Toggle the link to the HLTB game page

Cache:
- Cache Statistics: View the number of cached games and ID mappings
- Clear Cache: Clear all cached data

## Known Limitations

The plugin determines the HLTB game ID from two sources: the Steam import API (if your profile is public) and the [game IDs](./backend/game_ids.lua) file, which maps Steam AppIDs directly to HLTB game IDs. If neither source has an entry, the plugin falls back to a name-based search, which usually works but can fail when Steam and HLTB use different names. Feel free to submit a PR for any additional game ID mappings.

Also note that DLC and non-game content will not have HLTB data.

## How to add a game ID mapping

We'll use Final Fantasy Tactics for this example.

1. Navigate to the [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1004640/FINAL_FANTASY_TACTICS__The_Ivalice_Chronicles/) or [Steam Hunters](https://steamhunters.com/apps/1004640/achievements) page
2. Note the Steam App ID from the URL: `1004640`
3. Find the game on [HLTB](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/169173)
4. Note the HLTB game ID from the URL: `169173`

Add a line to the game_ids.lua file like this:
`[1004640] = 169173, -- Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles`

The format is `[STEAM_APPID] = HLTB_ID, -- HLTB Game Name`. The comment with the game name is required so we can recover if HLTB ever changes IDs.

You should add this correction to your local file and verify that it works before submitting a pull request:
`Steam/plugins/hltb-for-millennium/backend/game_ids.lua`

## How to submit a pull request (PR) from the Github website

If you are already familiar with PRs that is great, just do your thing. For new users, you can do this process entirely from the Github website, you just need a free Github account.

When you add the game ID mapping, it needs to be:
* in sorted order by Steam App ID
* not a duplicate
* correct syntax: `[APPID] = HLTB_ID, -- Game Name`
* include a comment with the HLTB game name

An automated check will make sure that all of these are true before your change can be accepted.

You **must** test it on your local copy before submitting it. I can't test it for you because I probably don't own the game. Other users can't test it for you because they are in different regions and might have other issues going on. It is very important that you test it first - see instructions in the last section.

PR instructions:
1. Fork this repo (click the "Fork" button at the top right)
2. Click "Create Fork" to make your own version of the repo - this is where you'll make your edit and then request that the main repo pulls from it
3. In your fork, navigate to the file you want to edit: `backend/game_ids.lua`
4. Click the pencil icon to edit the file
5. Make your changes, update the commit message to something descriptive, and click "Commit changes"
6. Go back to the original repo and click "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
7. Click "compare across forks" and select your fork as the head repository
8. Click "Create pull request", add a description, and submit
9. On the pull request page make sure that all tests are passing (green) - if a test fails then you need to fix it

Official Github instructions:
* [Forking](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
* [Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

## Development

Pull requests are welcome and appreciated! See the [development docs](./docs/README.md).

For game ID additions please submit a pull request, direct submissions are not accepted. Automated tests will run and check for common problems.

Before submitting a game ID mapping, please test it locally by editing: `Steam/plugins/hltb-for-millennium/backend/game_ids.lua`. This is also the fastest way to add a mapping - the full release process for this repository and the Millennium plugin database can take 1-2 weeks or more.
